Math Texas Essential Knowledge and Skill Tracker 
Project Overview
The TEKS Tracker is a live Google Sheets document created to monitor 8th-grade math performance based on Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) standards. This tool helps teachers, students, and parents easily track academic progress and class averages across different class periods while maintaining student confidentiality.

Purpose
The TEKS Tracker:

Displays average performance for each TEKS tested.
Provides teachers and parents with insight into student progress.
Helps students monitor their own progress by creating personal copies of the tracker.
By visualizing student performance, this tool identifies areas where students may require additional support, such as:

Reteaching specific topics
Tutoring
Quick assessments for skill reinforcement
Features
Class Period Tracking: See class-wide averages by TEKS, giving a broad view of how each group is performing.
Individual Student Progress: Students can make personal copies to track their own TEKS performance, giving them ownership of their learning.
Confidentiality: No individual scores are shared, ensuring privacy while still providing meaningful insights.
How to Use
For Teachers: Use the TEKS Tracker to monitor your classes’ average performance across all TEKS. Identify areas needing reteaching or further instruction.
For Students: Make a copy of the TEKS Tracker to track your personal progress on each TEKS standard. Use it to communicate with your teacher or parent about areas needing improvement.
For Parents: Review the tracker to get a clear picture of your child’s academic progress and discuss any concerns with their teacher.
Future Improvements
Add more visualization tools, like charts and graphs, to better analyze progress.
Automate the process of updating class scores using Google Sheets scripts.
